## Game Rules
- Clicking on a mine ends the game.
- Clicking on a square with an adjacent mine clears that square and shows the number of mines touching it.
- Clicking on a square with no adjacent mine clears that square and clicks all adjacent squares.
- The first click can never be a mine.
- The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.
- Right-clicking on a square places a flag on it. The flagged square can't be opened by a click.
- If the number in a square is equal to the number of squares touching that square that are flagged, double-clicking on the number opens up all remaining squares around the number. (Note: this won't work on touch screen devices)
- When the time countdown is over, you will lose 1 HP every 10 seconds. If you run out of HP, the game is over.
- You have 5 chances to use the "Super Star" to revert to the previous clicked step and restore full HP.
- When you complete the current rank, you will restore 1 HP.
